## Searching through text isn't all that hard.  
## We will implement an old-school vector space model of information retrieval, which
## is kind of how Hadoop still works today.
## Code thanks to https://www.r-bloggers.com/build-a-search-engine-in-20-minutes-or-less/

## We need these packages

install.packages("tm")
install.packages("SnowballC")

## We assume that doc1-doc7 below is our available document pool.

doc1 <- "Stray cats are running all over the place. I see 10 a day!"
doc2 <- "Cats are killers. They kill billions of animals a year."
doc3 <- "The best food in Columbus, OH is the North Market."
doc4 <- "Brand A is the best tasting cat food around. Your cat will love it."
doc5 <- "Buy Brand C cat food for your cat. Brand C makes healthy and happy cats."
doc6 <- "The Arnold Classic came to town this weekend. It reminds us to be healthy."
doc7 <- "I have nothing to say. In summary, I have told you nothing."

## This is the big file system, also called a "corpus."

doc.list <- list(doc1, doc2, doc3, doc4, doc5, doc6, doc7)
N.docs <- length(doc.list)
names(doc.list) <- paste0("doc", c(1:N.docs))

## And this is our search query

query <- "Healthy cat food"

## The Corpus class is a fundamental data structure in tm.
## We treated the query like any other document. It is, after all, just another string of text. 
## Queries are not typically known a priori, but in the processing steps that follow, 
## we will pretend like we knew ours in advance to avoid repeating steps.

library(tm)
library(SnowballC)
my.docs <- VectorSource(c(doc.list, query))
my.docs$Names <- c(names(doc.list), "query")
print(my.docs)

my.corpus <- Corpus(my.docs)
my.corpus
inspect(my.corpus)

###################### Transforming Text #############################

## One of the nice things about the Corpus class is the tm_map function, which cleans and 
## standardizes documents within a Corpus object. Below are some of the transformations.

getTransformations()

## First, let's get rid of punctuation.

my.corpus <- tm_map(my.corpus, removePunctuation)
my.corpus$doc1

## Stray cats are running all over the place I see 10 a day

## Suppose we don't want to count "cats" and "cat" as two separate words. Then we will 
## use the stemDocument transformation to implement the famous Porter Stemmer algorithm. 
## To use this particular transformation, first load the Snowball package.

library(SnowballC)
my.corpus <- tm_map(my.corpus, stemDocument)
my.corpus$doc1

## Stray cat are run all over the place I see 10 a day

## Finally, remove numbers and any extra white space.

my.corpus <- tm_map(my.corpus, removeNumbers)
my.corpus <- tm_map(my.corpus, tolower)
my.corpus <- tm_map(my.corpus, stripWhitespace)
my.corpus$doc1

## stray cat are run all over the place i see a day

##################### Vector Space Model #############################

## Here's a trick that's been around for a while: represent each document as a vector in 
## \( \mathcal{R}^N \) (with \( N \) as the number of words) and use the angle \( \theta \) 
## between the vectors as a similarity measure. Rank by the similarity of each document to 
## the query and you have a search engine.

## One of the simplest things we can do is to count words within documents. This naturally 
## forms a two dimensional structure, the term document matrix, with rows corresponding to 
## the words and the columns corresponding to the documents. As with any matrix, we may think 
## of a term document matrix as a collection of column vectors existing in a space defined 
## by the rows. The query lives in this space as well, though in practice we wouldn't know 
## it beforehand.

term.doc.matrix.stm <- TermDocumentMatrix(my.corpus)
inspect(term.doc.matrix.stm[0:14, ])

## The matrices in tm are of type Simple Triplet Matrix where only the triples \( (i, j, value) \) 
## are stored for non-zero values. To work directly with these objects, you may use install the 
## slam [4] package. We bear some extra cost by making the matrix "dense" (i.e., storing all the zeros).

term.doc.matrix <- as.matrix(term.doc.matrix.stm)

cat("Dense matrix representation costs", object.size(term.doc.matrix), "bytes.\n", 
    "Simple triplet matrix representation costs", object.size(term.doc.matrix.stm), 
    "bytes.")

## In term.doc.matrix, the dimensions of the document space are simple term frequencies. 
## This is fine, but other heuristics are available. For instance, rather than a linear increase 
## in the term frequency \( tf \), perhaps \( \sqrt(tf) \) or \( \log(tf) \) would provide a more 
## reasonable diminishing returns on word counts within documents.
## Rare words can also get a boost. The word "healthy" appears in only one document, whereas 
## "cat" appears in four. A word's document frequency \( df \) is the number of documents that 
## contain it, and a natural choice is to weight words inversely proportional to their \( df \)s. 
## As with term frequency, we may use logarithms or other transformations to achieve the desired 
## effect.
## The tm() function weightTfIdf offers one variety of tfidf weighting, but below we build our own. 
## For both the document and query, we choose tfidf weights of \( (1 + \log_2(tf)) \times \log_2(N/df) \), 
## which are defined to be \( 0 \) if \( tf = 0 \). Note that whenever a term does not occur in 
## a specific document, or when it appears in every document, its weight is zero.
## We implement this weighting function across entire rows of the term document matrix, and 
## therefore our tfidf function must take a term frequency vector and a document frequency scalar as inputs.

get.tf.idf.weights <- function(tf.vec, df) {
  # Computes tfidf weights from a term frequency vector and a document
  # frequency scalar
  weight = rep(0, length(tf.vec))
  weight[tf.vec > 0] = (1 + log2(tf.vec[tf.vec > 0])) * log2(N.docs/df)
  weight
}

cat("A word appearing in 4 of 6 documents, occuring 1, 2, 3, and 6 times, respectively: \n", 
    get.tf.idf.weights(c(1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 6), 4))

## Using apply, we run the tfidf weighting function on every row of the term document matrix. 
## The document frequency is easily derived from each row by the counting the non-zero entries 
## (not including the query).

get.weights.per.term.vec <- function(tfidf.row) {
  term.df <- sum(tfidf.row[1:N.docs] > 0)
  tf.idf.vec <- get.tf.idf.weights(tfidf.row, term.df)
  return(tf.idf.vec)
}

tfidf.matrix <- t(apply(term.doc.matrix, c(1), FUN = get.weights.per.term.vec))
colnames(tfidf.matrix) <- colnames(term.doc.matrix)

tfidf.matrix[0:3, ]

################### Implementing Cosine Similarity #########################

## Remember Cosine Similarity?  It's baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!!!
## A benefit of being in the vector space \( \mathcal{R}^N \) is the use of its dot product. 
## For vectors \( a \) and \( b \), the geometric definition of the dot product is 
## \( a \cdot b = \vert\vert a\vert\vert \, \vert\vert b \vert \vert \cos \theta \), where 
## \( \vert\vert \cdot \vert \vert \) is the euclidean norm (the root sum of squares) and 
## \( \theta \) is the angle between \( a \) and \( b \).
## In fact, we can work directly with the cosine of \( \theta \). For \( \theta \) in the interval 
## \( [-\pi, -\pi] \), the endpoints are orthogonality (totally unrelated documents) and the 
## center, zero, is complete collinearity (maximally similar documents). We can see that the 
## cosine decreases from its maximum value of \( 1.0 \) as the angle departs from zero in 
## either direction.

angle <- seq(-pi, pi, by = pi/16)
plot(cos(angle) ~ angle, type = "b", xlab = "angle in radians", main = "Cosine similarity by angle")

## We may furthermore normalize each column vector in our tfidf matrix so that its norm is one. 
## Now the dot product is \( \cos \theta \).

tfidf.matrix <- scale(tfidf.matrix, center = FALSE, scale = sqrt(colSums(tfidf.matrix^2)))
tfidf.matrix[0:3, ]

## Keeping the query alongside the other documents let us avoid repeating the same steps. 
## But now it's time to pretend it was never there.

query.vector <- tfidf.matrix[, (N.docs + 1)]
tfidf.matrix <- tfidf.matrix[, 1:N.docs]

## With the query vector and the set of document vectors in hand, it is time to go after the 
## cosine similarities. These are simple dot products as our vectors have been normalized to 
## unit length.
## Recall that matrix multiplication is really just a sequence of vector dot products. 
## The matrix operation below returns values of \( \cos \theta \) for each document vector 
## and the query vector.

doc.scores <- t(query.vector) %*% tfidf.matrix

## With scores in hand, rank the documents by their cosine similarities with the query vector.

results.df <- data.frame(doc = names(doc.list), score = t(doc.scores), text = unlist(doc.list))
results.df <- results.df[order(results.df$score, decreasing = TRUE), ]

## Let's try this out:

options(width = 2000)
print(results.df, row.names = FALSE, right = FALSE, digits = 2)

## Our "best" document, at least in an intuitive sense, comes out ahead with a score nearly 
## twice as high as its nearest competitor. Notice however that this next competitor has nothing 
## to do with cats. This is due to the relative rareness of the word "healthy" in the documents 
## and our choice to incorporate the inverse document frequency weighting for both documents 
## and query. Fortunately, the profoundly uninformative document 7 has been ranked dead last.
