Answer the following questions (5 pts each):

What associations have you discovered about the movie ratings?
What is the most prevalent general rule for movie ratings in your dataset? (Remember the children in 2nd class on the Titanic!)  
Remember to show your code and its output!

As an extra exercise to Chapter 2, the Guide To Data Minining book website has a file containing movie ratings for 25 movies.  Based on the recommender.py code discussed last week and this week:

If you choose to use Python, create a function that loads the data into your classifier.  If you choose to use R, set up your script to load the data into your data frame.
If you choose to use Python, add to the recommend method to recommend movies for a specific person.  If you choose to use R, follow the apriori instructions earlier in this slide deck and any of the distance formulas discussed in earlier weeks.
Answer the two questions you are given in this assignment and remember to show your code and its output.
